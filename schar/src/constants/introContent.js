    title1: "Early Chinese Characters in Sound Visualization",
    description1: `Based on the logic of early Chinese character creation, this study
        proposes a "shape, meaning, and sound" reconstruction method,
        aiming to explore new possibilities of symbol design through the
        comprehensive construction of shape (visual structure), meaning
        (symbolic semantics), and sound (sound). Therefore, during the
        symbol application practice stage, this study paid special
        attention to the dynamics, multi-sensory expression and
        cross-media adaptability of the symbol system, in order to
        construct an innovative design concept that is consistent with the
        traditional Chinese character creation logic and adaptable to
        modern symbol systems.`,

    description2: "This is a step-by-step operation guide and notes:",
    steps: [
      "Step 1: Click the Start button and tell the computer any sound you want to make",
      "Step 2: Observe how the symbol changes based on the sound input", 
      "Step 3: You can select the switch button to switch between different symbols for interaction",
      "Note: You can choose to press the Pause button to stop the interaction"

    title3: "Innovation",
    description3: `This study proposes an innovative "shape, meaning and sound"
          reconstruction method based on the combination of traditional
          Chinese character creation logic and modern graphic symbol
          design, realizing the digital, systematized and visualized
          expression of Chinese character cultural elements. Explore the
          mapping relationship between sound and graphic symbols, and
          propose a symbol visualization method based on phonological
          features.`,
    innovations: [
      "A method of \"shape, meaning and sound\" reconstruction is proposed to achieve multimodal fusion of Chinese characters.",
      "Construct a \"shape, meaning and sound\" digital symbol library and explore real-time symbol generation based on parameterization.",
      "Explore the mapping relationship between sound and graphic symbols, and propose a symbol visualization method based on phonological features."
